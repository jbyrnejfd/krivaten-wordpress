#Viral Bootstrap#
This is a Wordpress theme I built using various libraries I've grown quite font of in my experience.

This theme was largely built to suit my particular workflow, but if you by chance use the same set up I do (Or want to adopt it), then you will likely love this theme. So enjoy it.

##Features##
* Swipable mobile nav drawer using [touchSwipe](https://github.com/mattbryson/TouchSwipe-Jquery-Plugin)
* Styles for [Gravity Forms](http://www.gravityforms.com/)
* Theme admin for Social Networking URLs and Google Analytics code
* LESS and JS compiled and minified using [PrePros](https://github.com/sbspk/Prepros)
* Menu walkers for navbar and drawer to add necessary classes

##Shortcodes##
I did my best to create shortcodes for all the Bootstrap elements (And then some) that I felt one would be likely to use. These include:

* Accordion
* Alert
* Checklist
* Grid
* Icon
* Pre
* Quote
* Vimeo Video
* Well
* YouTube Video
* And more...
