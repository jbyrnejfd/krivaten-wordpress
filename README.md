#Viral Bootstrap#

This is a Wordpress theme I built using various libraries I've grown quite font of.

As the name implies, it is based in Bootstrap 3, but using touchSwipe, I added a swipable menu drawer that I have tested back to Android 2.2.

In addition, since I use Gravity Forms and PrePros while building my sites, I have built in support for those.

This theme was really custom built for me and my particular workflow, but if you by chance use the same set up I do (Or want to adopt it), then you will likely love this theme. So enjoy it.
